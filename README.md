# Cats vs Dogs Image Classification

This project implements a convolutional neural network (CNN) in TensorFlow/Keras to classify images of cats and dogs.

## Features
- Dataset preprocessing (train, validation, test split)
- Model training and evaluation
- Prediction on new images
- Colab-ready notebook

## Tools
- Python, TensorFlow/Keras, NumPy, Google Colab

## Usage
1. Open `notebook.ipynb` in Google Colab
2. Run all cells to train the model
3. Use `predict()` function to classify new images
